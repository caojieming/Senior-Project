# Senior Project (Tron)

This is a part of my senior project for learning how to create and code a website.

It's a simple recreation of Tron, and it includes 1-player and 2-player modes.

To open tron locally, open terminal, locate the "senior-project" folder, and input:

```bash
make dev
```

Then, copy and paste the link given into a browser.

To stop the server, use [ctr + c].
